## Why
Udemy doesn't have automatic translation similar to YouTube. If your favorite Udemy course doesn't have translated captions, you are in trouble.

You might have been tried using Google Translate for page translation, but it translates the page in a one-off fashion. The active caption text is translated, but the next one appears in original language again.

As opposed to the captions, the transcription doesn't change dynamically. Once the transcript is translated you can follow along the course from there.

If you look closely, the active caption is also highlighted in the transcription. This extension simply copies the highlighted transcription text into the active caption.
